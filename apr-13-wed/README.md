## Data Conversion in C++
A user-defined data types are designed by the user to suit their requirements, the compiler does not support automatic type conversions for such data types therefore, the user needs to design the conversion routines by themselves if required.
There can be 3 types of situations that may come in the date conversion between incompatible data types.
* Conversion of primitive data type to user-defined data type: To perform this operation, the idea is to use the constructor to perform type conversion during the object creation. Below is the example to convert int to user-defined data type.
* Conversion from user-defined data type to primitive data type.
